# **TurtleChaser**

## <u>**Idea**</u>  
A main turtle (a.k.a. chaser) that will chase the other turtles, spawning only when the previous one is chased.

## <u>**Solution**</u>  
- [x] Creating a controller node that will control the linear and angular velocity of the *chaser turtle* as per the spawning of the other turtles.
- [x] Creating a spawner node that will spawn turtles only when the previous one is chased.
- [ ] Using P controller to guide the chaser to the spawned turtle.
- [ ] Creating a launch file to launch all the required nodes in one go!

This is my first ROS project! Very proud :))  
I'm not good when it comes to naming stuff xd :'(
